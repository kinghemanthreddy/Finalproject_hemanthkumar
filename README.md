## Customer Segmentation and Retention For Bank Using ML
Customer churn poses a significant challenge for banks, affecting revenue and customer satisfaction. Using Machine Learning Algorithms Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and AdaBoost classifiers, to predict and minimize churn rates. 


## About
The use of machine learning algorithms can be a powerful tool for predicting customer churn in the bank sector.
These algorithms can analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns and relationships that are not easily apparent to the human eye. 
By using machine learning algorithms, companies can make more accurate predictions about which customers are likely to churn and take action to retain them.


## Features
In develop a predictive model that is robust and scalable, taking intoaccount data quality, customer behaviour complexity, and high- dimensional data. 
Incresing  model interpretability, so that the results of the model can beunderstood and used by stakeholders to make informed decisions. 
To evaluate the performance of the model and compare it to other models, taking into account predictive performance metrics and overall model accuracy

Detection Accuracy: 90%


## Results and Impact
Preprocessing involves handling challenges like duplicate values, missing data, and categorical features through feature engineering and encoding.
Imbalanced datasets addressed using NearMiss algorithm for under sampling to improve generalization.
Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score serve as benchmarks for model performance assessment.
Hyperparameter tuning enhances AdaBoost model, demonstrating superior performance in achieving high precision rates on both training and test datasets.
